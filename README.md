# TODO

- Get rid of icospheres. They don't help.
- Design a centralised way to reconfigure lights/meshes in a smart way: that is, only reconfigure objects that need to be configured. Also, rename "configure" to what it is really is, which is creating MTLBuffers (at least for lights).
- Make the terms `Uniforms` and `Parameters` more specific.
- Rename `Common.h` to something more helpful 
- Rewrite the MTLRenderPass stuff for GBufferRenderPass and LightingRenderPass. The constraint idea is there, but not executed properly.
- Look into not manually rendering full-screen quads for lighting. I believe a quad _must_ be generated by the vertex function; it just might be possible for Metal to do it automatically. 

# Pipelines and buffers
- Steps
    - Create `MTLBuffer`s with `MTLDevice`. Need to specify:
        - bytes
        - MemoryLayout
    -
