# TODO

- Get rid of icospheres. They don't help.
- Design a centralised way to reconfigure lights/meshes in a smart way: that is, only reconfigure objects that need to be configured. Also, rename "configure" to what it is really is, which is creating MTLBuffers (at least for lights).
- Make the terms `Uniforms` and `Parameters` more specific.
- Rename `Common.h` to something more helpful
